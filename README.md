# Async-JavaScript-Tutorial

1. Asynchronous JavaScript: Governs how we perform tasks which can take some time to complete.
Example(Getting data from a database)
Async to the rescue: Basically it means to start something now and finish it later.

2. Synchronous Javascript: Means that JavaScript can run one statement at a time only.
Example{
    console.log("line one");
    console.log("line two");
    console.log("line three");
}

HTTP Requests:

1. Make HTTP requqests to get data from another server.
2. We make these requests to the API endpoints.
